# Harvard-Processor-Design-and-Architecture
##Project Overview
 Processor design is the design engineering task of creating a processor, a key component of computer
hardware. The design process involves choosing an instruction set and a certain execution paradigm,
and results in a microarchitecture. The mode of operation of any processor is the execution of lists of
instructions. Instructions typically include those to compute or manipulate data values using registers,
change or retrieve values in read/write memory, perform relational tests between data values and to
control program flow.
In this project, I am simulating a fictional processor design and architecture using Java.
